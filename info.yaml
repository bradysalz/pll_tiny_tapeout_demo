# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Phase Locked Loop Demo"
  description:  "This is a portion of a phase locked loop. Specifically, this project implements a phase/frequency detector and a divider."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "It relies on an extneral "      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  ""      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz: 0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  language: "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
